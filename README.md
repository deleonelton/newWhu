September 2016 - New WHUFU

The new responsive version of WHUFU. It's my vacation blog, but it's oh so much more.

Right now there are skeletal pages for most of the core pages. Most are simply wireframe-style lists of 
purpose, content and links, but the Trips page does list all trips and is the prototype of the landing page.

The current version is here:  http://whufu.com/
